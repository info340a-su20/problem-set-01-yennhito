    <h1>Ash Ketchum</h1>
    <img src="img/ash_ketchum.jpg" alt="Ash Ketchum, character from the cartoon series Pokémon">

    <p> Ash Ketchum is the main character of the popular animated series
        <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokémon</a></cite>.
        Ash Ketchum is a young boy who wants to become a Pokémon Master. His first Pokémon, Pikachu, is his
        best friend. The two travel place to place in the Pokémon universe making new friends along the way while
        going on crazy adventures. The main goal for Ash is to try to catch them all!
    </p>
    <h3>Reasons why I admire this character?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ash has stayed the age of 10 in the Pokémon series for the past 12 years, he does not age.
            But yet he is still the same ole' spirit </li>
        <li class="important"> Ash is determined. He set out to become a Pokémon Master and after 22 years he finally
            did it.
            He has the determination that all of us need in life</li>
        <li>Ash is loyal. Sure Ash wants to catch them all but he is loyal to his own Pokémon Pikachu.</li>
    </ul>
